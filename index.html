            <p>This article is about the geological phenomenon. For other uses, see Landslide (disambiguation).

                A landslide near Cusco, Peru, in 2018
                A NASA model has been developed to look at how potential landslide activity is changing around
                the
                world.

                Animation of a landslide in San Mateo County, California
                Landslides, also known as landslips, or rockslides,are several forms of mass wasting that may
                include a wide range of ground movements, such as rockfalls, mudflows, shallow or deep-seated
                slope
                failures
                and debris flows. Landslides occur in a variety of environments, characterized by either steep
                or
                gentle
                slope gradients, from mountain ranges to coastal cliffs or even underwater,in which case they
                are
                called
                submarine landslides.

                Gravity is the primary driving force for a landslide to occur, but there are other factors
                affecting
                slope
                stability that produce specific conditions that make a slope prone to failure. In many cases,
                the
                landslide
                is triggered by a specific event (such as a heavy rainfall, an earthquake, a slope cut to build
                a
                road,
                and
                many others), although this is not always identifiable.

                Landslides are frequently made worse by human development (such as urban sprawl) and resource
                exploitation
                (such as mining and deforestation). Land degradation frequently leads to less stabilization of
                soil
                by
                vegetation.Additionally, global warming caused by climate change and other human impact on the
                environment, can increase the frequency of natural events (such as extreme weather) which
                trigger
                landslides.Landslide mitigation describes the policy and practices for reducing the risk of
                human
                impacts of landslides, reducing the risk of natural disaster.

            <h2>cause</h2>
            <p>Landslides occur when the slope (or a portion of it) undergoes some processes that change its
                condition
                from
                stable to unstable. This is essentially due to a decrease in the shear strength of the slope
                material,
                an
                increase in the shear stress borne by the material, or a combination of the two. A change in the
                stability
                of a slope can be caused by a number of factors, acting together or alone. Natural causes of
                landslides
                include:
            <ul>
                <li>increase in water content (loss of suction) or saturation by rain water infiltration, snow
                    melting,
                    or
                    glaciers melting
                </li>
                <li>ising of groundwater or increase of pore water pressure (e.g. due to aquifer recharge in
                    rainy
                    seasons,
                    or by rain water infiltration)
                </li>
                <li>increase of hydrostatic pressure in cracks and fractures

                </li>
                <li>loss or absence of vertical vegetative structure, soil nutrients, and soil structure (e.g.
                    after
                    a
                    wildfire)
                </li>
                <li>erosion of the top of a slope by rivers or sea waves;

                </li>
                <li>hysical and chemical weathering (e.g. by repeated freezing and thawing, heating and cooling,
                    salt
                    leaking in the groundwater or mineral dissolution)

                </li>
                <li>ground shaking caused by earthquakes, which can destabilize the slope directly (e.g., by
                    inducing
                    soil
                    liquefaction) or weaken the material and cause cracks that will eventually produce a
                    landslid

                </li>
                <li>changes in pore fluid composition
                </li>
                <li>changes in temperature (seasonal or induced by climate change)

            <h2>wayanad land slide</h2>
            <p>2024 Wayanad landslides were a series of landslides that occurred at Punjirimattom,
                Mundakkai, Chooralmala,
                Attamala, Meppadi and Kunhome villages of Wayanad district, Kerala, India,
                in the early hours of 30 July
                2024. Heavy rains triggered the collapse of hillsides, resulting in torrents of mud, water, and
                boulders
                cascading down onto the area.
                The landslides marked one of the deadliest natural disasters in Kerala's
                history with reports of at least 429
                deaths, over 378 injuries, and more than 130 missing.the landslides are among several
                extreme
                weather
                events that have occurred in India in recent years.A natural disaster is the negative impact
                following an actual occurrence of natural hazard in the event that it significantly harms a
                community.
                An example of the distinction between a natural hazard and a disaster is that an earthquake is
                the
                hazard which caused the 1906 San Francisco earthquake disaster<a

                flood</h2>
            <p>Flooding is a temporary overflow of water onto land that is normally dry. Floods can result
                from
                rain, snow, coastal storms, storm surges, overflows of rivers, and dam failure. Floods can
                be
                dangerous. People die by drowning when they don't evacuate before floodwaters come or when
                they
                enter floodwaters.

                style=" display:inline-block;" width="450px">
            <p>A flood is an overflow of water (or rarely
                other
                fluids)
                that submerges land that is usually dry.In the sense of "flowing water", the word may also
                be
                applied to
                the
                inflow of the tide. Floods are of significant concern in agriculture, civil engineering and
                public
                health.
                Human
                changes to the environment often increase the intensity and frequency of flooding. Examples for
                human
                changes
                are land use changes such as deforestation and removal of wetlands, changes in waterway course
                or
                flood
                controls
                such as with levees. Global environmental issues also influence causes of floods, namely climate
                change
                which
                causes an intensification of the water cycle and sea level rise. For example, climate
                change
                makes
                extreme weather events more frequent and stronger. This leads to more intense floods and
                increased
                flood
                risk.

                The types of floods include areal flooding, riverine flooding, coastal flooding and urban
                flooding.
                There is
                also the intentional flooding of land that would otherwise remain dry. This may take place for
                agricultural,
                military, or river-management purposes. For example, agricultural flooding may occur in
                preparing
                paddy
                fields
                for the growing of semi-aquatic rice in many countries.

                Flooding may occur as an overflow of water from water bodies, such as a river, lake, or ocean.
                In
                these
                cases,
                the water overtops or breaks levees, resulting in some of that water escaping its usual
                boundaries.
                Flooding
                may also occur due to an accumulation of rainwater on saturated ground. This is called an areal
                flood.
                The
                size
                of a lake or other body of water naturally varies with seasonal changes in precipitation and
                snow
                melt.
                Those
                changes in size are however not considered a flood unless they flood property or drown domestic
                animals.

                Floods can also occur in rivers when the flow rate exceeds the capacity of the river channel,
                particularly
                at
                bends or meanders in the waterway. Floods often cause damage to homes and businesses if these
                buildings
                are
                in
                the natural flood plains of rivers. People could avoid riverine flood damage by moving away from
                rivers.
                However, people in many countries have traditionally lived and worked by rivers because the land
                is
                usually
                flat
                and fertile. Also, the rivers provide easy travel and access to commerce and industry.

                Flooding can damage property and also lead to secondary impacts. These include in the short term
                an
                increased
                spread of waterborne diseases and vector-bourne disesases, for example those diseases
                transmitted by
                mosquitos.
                Flooding can also lead to long-term displacement of residents. Floods are an area of study of
                hydrology
                and
                hydraulic engineering.
            <h3>floodcontrol</h3>
            <p>Flood control (or flood mitigation, protection or alleviation) methods are used to reduce or
                prevent
                the
                detrimental effects of flood waters.Flooding can be caused by a mix of both natural
                processes,
                such
                as extreme weather upstream, and human changes to waterbodies and runoff. Flood control methods
                can
                be
                either of the structural type and of the non-structural type. Structural methods hold back
                floodwaters
                physically, while non-structural methods do not. Building hard infrastructure to prevent
                flooding,
                such
                as
                flood walls, is effective at managing flooding. However, best practice within landscape
                engineering
                is
                more
                and more to rely on soft infrastructure and natural systems, such as marshes and flood plains,
                for
                handling
                the increase in water.

                To prevent or manage coastal flooding, coastal management practices have to handle natural
                processes
                like
                tides but also sea level rise due to climate change. Flood control is an important part of
                climate
                change
                adaptation and climate resilience.

                Flood control is part of environmental engineering. It involves the management of flood water
                movement,
                such
                as redirecting flood run-off through the use of floodwalls and flood gates, rather than trying
                to
                prevent
                floods altogether. It also involves the management of people, through measures such as
                evacuation
                and
                flood
                proofing properties. The prevention and mitigation of flooding can be studied on three levels:
                on
                individual
                properties, small communities, and whole towns or cities.

                Terminology
                There are a number of similar terms that are all used interchangeably: Flood control, flood
                mitigation,
                flood protection and flood alleviation are all terms that mean "the detention and/or diversion
                of
                water
                during flood events for the purpose of reducing discharge or downstream inundation". They
                include
                methods
                that are used to reduce or prevent the detrimental effects of flood waters.

                A distinction is made between structural and non-structural flood mitigation:

                Structural flood control is the reduction of the effects of a flood using physical solutions,
                such
                as
                reservoirs, levees, dredging and diversions.
                Non-structural flood control include for example land-use planning, advanced warning systems and
                flood
                insurance. Further examples for this type of flood control are: "zoning ordinances and codes,
                flood
                forecasting, flood proofing, evacuation and channel clearing, flood fight activities, and
                upstream
                land
                treatment or management to control flood damages without physically restraining flood
                waters".
                Flood management (or flood risk management) is a broader term that includes mitigating and
                preparing
                for
                flooding disasters, and providing risk analysis for example through the practice of flood risk
                assessment. In the context of natural hazards and disasters, risk management involves "plans,
                actions,
                strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential
                consequences,
                based on
                assessed or perceived risks".

                Flood relief methods are used to reduce the effects of flood waters or high water levels.

                        place,
                        sometimes to hazardous depths. Surface soil can become saturated, which effectively
                        stops
                        infiltration, where the water table is shallow, such as a floodplain, or from intense
                        rain
                        from
                        one or a series of storms. Infiltration also is slow to negligible through frozen
                        ground,
                        rock,
                        concrete, paving, or roofs. Areal flooding begins in flat areas like floodplains and in
                        local
                        depressions not connected to a stream channel, because the velocity of overland flow
                        depends
                        on
                        the surface slope. Endorheic basins may experience areal flooding during periods when
                        precipitation exceeds evaporation

                    <p>
                        Coastal areas may be flooded by storm surges combining with high tides and large wave
                        events
                        at
                        sea, resulting in waves over-topping flood defenses or in severe cases by tsunami or
                        tropical
                        cyclones. A storm surge, from either a tropical cyclone or an extratropical cyclone,
                        falls
                        within this category. A storm surge is "an additional rise of water generated by a
                        storm,
                        over
                        and above the predicted astronomical tides". Due to the effects of climate change
                        (e.g.
                        sea
                        level rise and an increase in extreme weather events) and an increase in the population
                        living
                        in coastal areas, the damage caused by coastal flood events has intensified and more
                        people
                        are
                        being affected.

                        Flooding in estuaries is commonly caused by a combination of storm surges caused by
                        winds
                        and

                        Urban flooding</a>
                    <p>is the inundation of land or property in cities or other built environment,
                        caused
                        by rainfall or coastal storm surges overwhelming the capacity of drainage systems, such
                        as
                        storm
                        sewers. Urban flooding can occur regardless of whether or not affected communities are
                        located
                        within designated floodplains or near any body of water. It is triggered for example
                        by
                        an
                        overflow of rivers and lakes, flash flooding or snowmelt. During the flood, stormwater
                        or
                        water
                        released from damaged water mains may accumulate on property and in public
                        rights-of-way. It
                        can
                        seep through building walls and floors, or backup into buildings through sewer pipes,
                        cellars,
                        toilets and sinks. There are several types of urban flooding, each with a different
                        cause.
                        City
                        planners distinguish pluvial flooding (flooding caused by heavy rain), fluvial flooding
                        (caused
                        by a nearby river overflowing its banks), or coastal flooding (often caused by storm
                        surges).
                        Urban flooding is a hazard to both the population and infrastructure. Some well known
                        disaster
                        events include the inundations of Nîmes (France) in 1998 and Vaison-la-Romaine (France)

            <h1> environmental pollution
            </h1>
            <p>
                " Environmental pollution" Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural
                environment
                that
                cause adverse change. Pollution can take the form of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or
                energy
                (such
                as radioactivity, heat, sound, or light). Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either
                foreign
                substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants. Although environmental pollution can be
                caused
                by
                natural events, the word pollution generally implies that the contaminants have an anthropogenic
                source
                that
                is, a source created by human activities, such as manufacturing, extractive industries, poor
                waste
                management, transportation or agriculture. Pollution is often classed as point source (coming
                from a
                highly
                concentrated specific site, such as a factory, mine, construction site), or nonpoint source
                pollution
                (coming from a widespread distributed sources, such as microplastics or agricultural runoff).
                Many
                sources
                of pollution were unregulated parts of industrialization during the 19th and 20th centuries
                until
                the
                emergence of environmental regulation and pollution policy in the later half of the 20th
                century.
                Sites
                where historically polluting industries released persistent pollutants may have legacy pollution
                long
                after
                the source of the pollution is stopped. Major forms of pollution include air pollution, water
                pollution,
                litter, noise pollution, plastic pollution, soil contamination, radioactive contamination,
                thermal
                pollution, light pollution, and visual pollution. Pollution has widespread consequences on human
                and
                environmental health, having systematic impact on social and economic systems. In 2019,
                pollution
                killed
                approximately nine million people worldwide (about one in six deaths that year); about
                three-quarters of
                these deaths were caused by air pollution. A 2022 literature review found that levels of
                anthropogenic
                chemical pollution have exceeded planetary boundaries and now threaten entire ecosystems around
                the
                world.
                Pollutants frequently have outsized impacts on vulnerable populations, such as children and the
                elderly,
                and
                marginalized communities, because polluting industries and toxic waste sites tend to be
                collocated
                with
                populations with less economic and political power This outsized impact is a core reason for the
                formation
                of the environmental justice movement,and continues to be a core element of environmental
                conflicts,
                particularly in the Global South. Because of the impacts of these chemicals, local and
                international
                countries' policy have increasingly sought to regulate pollutants, resulting in increasing air
                and
                water
                quality standards, alongside regulation of specific waste streams. Regional and national policy
                is
                typically
                supervised by environmental agencies or ministries, while international efforts are coordinated
                by
                the
                UN
                Environmental Program and other treaty bodies. Pollution mitigation is an important part of all
                of
                the
                Sustainable Development Goals.

                    These
                    harmful
                    materials are called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They
                    can
                    also be
                    created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollutants
                    damage
                    the
                    quality
                    of air, water, and land.

                    Many things that are useful to people produce pollution. Cars spew pollutants from their
                    exhaust
                    pipes.
                    Burning coal to create electricity pollutes the air. Industries and homes generate
                    garbage
                    and
                    sewage
                    that can pollute the land and water. Pesticides—chemical poisons used to kill weeds and
                    insects—seep
                    into waterways and harm wildlife.

                    All living things—from one-celled microbes to blue whales—depend on Earth’s supply of
                    air
                    and water.
                    When these resources are polluted, all forms of life are threatened.

                    Pollution is a global problem. Although urban areas are usually more polluted than the
                    countryside,
                    pollution can spread to remote places where no people live. For example, pesticides and
                    other
                    chemicals
                    have been found in the Antarctic ice sheet. In the middle of the northern Pacific Ocean,
                    a
                    huge
                    collection of microscopic plastic particles forms what is known as the Great Pacific

                    Air and water currents carry pollution. Ocean currents and migrating fish carry marine
                    pollutants

                    and wide. Winds can pick up radioactive material accidentally released from a nuclear
                    reactor and
                    scatter it around the world. Smoke from a factory in one country drifts into another
                    country.

                    In the past, visitors to Big Bend National Park in the U.S. state of Texas could see 290
                    kilometers
                    (180
                    miles) across the vast landscape. Now, coal-burning power plants in Texas and the
                    neighboring state
                    of
                    Chihuahua, Mexico have spewed so much pollution into the air that visitors to Big Bend
                    can
                    sometimes
                    see
                    only 50 kilometers (30 miles).

                    The three major types of pollution are air pollution, water pollution, and land

                <h1>Nature Conservation</h1>
                <p>Conservation goals include conserving habitat, preventing deforestation,
                    maintaining soil organic matter, halting species extinction, reducing overfishing, and
                    mitigating climate change. Different philosophical outlooks guide conservationists towards
                    these
                    different goals.

                    The principal value underlying many expressions of the conservation ethic is that the
                    natural
                    world has intrinsic and intangible worth along with utilitarian value a view carried forward
                    by parts of the scientific conservation movement and some of the older Romantic schools of
                    the
                    ecology movement. Philosophers have attached intrinsic value to different aspects of nature,
                    whether this is individual organisms (biocentrism) or ecological wholes such as species or
                    ecosystems (ecoholism).

                    More utilitarian schools of conservation have an anthropocentric outlook and seek a proper
                    valuation of local and global impacts of human activity upon nature in their effect upon
                    human
                    wellbeing, now and to posterity. How such values are assessed and exchanged among people
                    determines the social, political and personal restraints and imperatives by which
                    conservation
                    is practiced. This is a view common in the modern environmental movement. There is
                    increasing
                    interest in extending the responsibility for human wellbeing to include the welfare of
                    sentient
                    animals. In 2022 the United Kingdom introduced the Animal Welfare (Sentience) Act which
                    lists
                    all vertebrates, decapod crustaceans and cephalopods as sentient beings. Branches of
                    conservation ethics focusing on sentient individuals include ecofeminism and compassionate
                    conservation.

                    In the United States of America, the year 1864 saw the publication of two books which laid
                    the
                    foundation for Romantic and Utilitarian conservation traditions in America. The posthumous
                    publication of Henry David Thoreau's Walden established the grandeur of unspoiled nature as
                    a
                    citadel to nourish the spirit of man. A very different book from George Perkins Marsh, Man
                    and
                    Nature, later subtitled " The Earth as Modified by Human Action", catalogued his
                    observations of
                    man exhausting and altering the land from which his sustenance derives. The consumer
                    conservation
                    ethic has been defined as the attitudes and behaviors held and engaged in by individuals and
                    families that ultimately serve to reduce overall societal consumption of energy. The
                    conservation
                    movement has emerged from the advancements of moral reasoning.Increasing numbers of
                    philosophers
                    and
                    scientists have made its maturation possible by considering the relationships between human
                    beings
                    and organisms with the same rigor. This social ethic primarily relates to local
                    purchasing,
                    moral purchasing, the sustained, and efficient use of renewable resources, the moderation of
                    destructive use of finite resources, and the prevention of harm to common resources such as
                    air
                    and
                    water quality, the natural functions of a living earth, and cultural values in a built
                    environment.
                    These practices are used to slow down the accelerating rate in which extinction is occurring
                    at.
                    The
                    origins of this ethic can be traced back to many different philosophical and religious
                    beliefs;
                    that
                    is, these practices has been advocated for centuries. In the past, conservationism has been
                    categorized under a spectrum of views, including anthropocentric, utilitarian
                    conservationism,
                    and
                    radical eco-centric green eco-political views. More recently, the three major movements has
                    been
                    grouped to become what we now know as conservation ethic. The person credited with
                    formulating
                    the
                    conservation ethic in the United States is former president, Theodore Roosevelt. </p>
